# Directory Structure

Subdirectories within the `Music` folder:

* `Personal`: Music files intended for personal listening. These are lossless format as much as possible, but may also include scrappy rips that I downloaded as a teenager.
* `DJ`: Music files intended for being used in DJ sets. These should be 320k MP3 files unless there is a very good reason for them not to be, as this is the most compatible high quality format for things like CDJs. Rekordbox should only be looking in the `DJ` folder, so tracks in other folders should always be copied or moved here.
* `Draft`: Rips from online, or other potentially lower-quality files, which are downloaded in order for them to be experimented with in set preparation. These files are intended to be replaced with a full quality version bought when the track is confirmed to be needed.

# Phrasing

In DnB tracks, a phrase is typically 16 bars (16 * 4 = 64 beats). This equates to four taps on the 16-beat beat jump button on a CDJ.

# Memory Cues

CDJ memory cues should be used to indicate potential "mix crossover points" - where the vibe of what's being played in a mix can switch from one track to the next. Crossover points will usually occur on boundaries of different sections of a track, eg. when the first main section transitions into a breakdown.

Memory cues earlier in a track will usually be used as "mix in" points for that track. Memory cues later in the track will usually be used as "mix out" points. A countdown of the number of bars to the next memory cue can be shown alongside the waveform, to assess how much of the track is left until a crossover should occur.

# Hot Cues

The primary use of CDJ hot cues should be to indicate positions where a mix of a new track should begin. They should establish sections of "runway", usually one or two phrases, leading up to a memory cue.

Consequently, hot cues should *not* usually be placed on a boundary between two distinct sections of a track, since the boundary should be the crossover point, and there would be no space to mix the track in up to that boundary. An exception to this would be if the runway to a memory cue happens to place a hot cue on a previous boundary; the hot cue should not be used to mix in to the boundary it is on top of, but rather the next one.

## Hot Cue Banks

Older CDJ controllers may only have three hot cue buttons available; therefore, the first three hot cues should always be reserved for the three most appropriate sections of runway in a track. This is usually:

* **A:** One phrase before the first drop.
* **B:** Two phrases before the first drop - particularly if there is a breakdown before the first drop, in which case it provides runway to this.
* **C:** One phrase before the middle breakdown.

Newer CDJ controllers may have two separate banks of four hot cues, making a total of eight. Since the first bank will be active by default, it should be used to store the most convenient set of hot cues, and the second bank may be used to store hot cues which do not need to be as readily available. For example, loops could be stored in the second bank, since if the hardware does not support the second bank of hot cues then the loops may still be constructed live using the dedicated loop buttons.

## Gating

The setting "During pause, GATE playback is applied to hot cues" should be disabled, so that hot cues continue playing once the button is released. This is so that a hot cue can be set playing using only one hand. If the setting were turned on, and the play button needed to be pressed to keep a hot cue playing on a CDJ, this may require two hands to accomplish.

## Colours

Hot cues can be assigned colours, which should be categorised as follows:

* **Green:** General-purpose hot cue.
* **Yellow:** Hot cue where vocals begin after the runway. This does not apply if the vocals are already present in the runway.
* **Orange:** Inactive loop aligned to the beginning of a phrase.
* **Turquoise:** Inactive loop not aligned to the beginning of a phrase.

Think of green representing percussion, blue representing no percussion, and red representing vocals. Adding red to green in RGB space gives yellow, and adding it to blue gives pink.

# Energy Levels

Star ratings are used to denote energy levels for tracks. The levels are based loosely around the following examples:

* **1 Star (Relax):** London Grammar - If You Wait (Calibre Alternate Remix)
* **2 Stars (Vibe):** DRS, Tyler Daley & Calibre - I Remember
* **3 Stars (Groove):** Logistics - Cascades Of Colour
* **4 Stars (Dance):** High Contrast - Racing Green
* **5 Stars (Rave):** Netsky - Love Has Gone
