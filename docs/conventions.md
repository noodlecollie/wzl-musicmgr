# Directory Structure

Subdirectories within the `Music` folder:

* `Personal`: Music files intended for personal listening. These are lossless format as much as possible, but may also include scrappy rips that I downloaded as a teenager.
* `DJ`: Music files intended for being used in DJ sets. These should be 320k MP3 files unless there is a very good reason for them not to be, as this is the most compatible high quality format for things like CDJs. Rekordbox should only be looking in the `DJ` folder, so tracks in other folders should always be copied or moved here.
* `Draft`: Rips from online, or other potentially lower-quality files, which are downloaded in order for them to be experimented with in set preparation. These files are intended to be replaced with a full quality version bought when the track is confirmed to be needed.

# Phrasing

In DnB tracks, a phrase is typically 16 bars (16 * 4 = 64 beats). This equates to four taps on the 16-beat beat jump button on a CDJ.

# Memory Cues

CDJ memory cues should be used as reference points in a track, which indicate its general structure. Most tracks should have memory cues:

* On the first beat of the intro
* At the first drop
* On the first beat of the breakdown
* At the second drop
* At the first beat of the outro
* At the last beat of the outro

A countdown of the number of bars to the next memory cue can be useful to assess how much of the track is left until it changes structure.

Memory cues will often be used as mix-out points.

# Hot Cues

CDJ hot cues should be placed at mix-in points, where the beginning of a transition into the track would begin. Given older CDJ kit may only have three hot cue buttons, the first hot cues should be used to mark the most helpful mix-in points. These are usually:

1. One phrase before the first drop
2. One phrase before the second drop

Other hot cues may be assigned to other points that could be useful, eg. two phrases before a drop.

## Gating

The setting "During pause, GATE playback is applied to hot cues" should be disabled, so that hot cues continue playing once the button is released. This is so that a hot cue can be set playing using only one hand. If the setting were turned on, and the play button needed to be pressed to keep a hot cue playing on a CDJ, this may require two hands to accomplish.

## Colours

Hot cues can be assigned colours, which should be categorised as follows:

* **Green:** Breakdown or build-up with percussion and without vocals
* **Blue**: Breakdown or build-up without percussion and without vocals
* **Yellow**: Breakdown or build-up with percussion and with vocals
* **Pink**: Breakdown or build-up without percussion and with vocals

Think of green representing percussion, blue representing no percussion, and red representing vocals. Adding red to green in RGB space gives yellow, and adding it to blue gives pink.

# Energy Levels

Star ratings are used to denote energy levels for tracks. The levels are based loosely around the following examples:

* 1 star: London Grammar - If You Wait (Calibre Alternate Remix)
* 2 stars: Nu:Tone - The Moment
* 3 stars: Logistics - Cascades Of Colour
* 4 stars: High Contrast - Racing Green
* 5 stars: Netsky - Love Has Gone
